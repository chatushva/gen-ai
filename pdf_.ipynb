            "    *   A live demo (if deployed).\n",

            "    *   For the Food Ordering Website: \"Implemented CRUD operations for food items and user orders using RESTful APIs.\" -> *Could you mention how many types of items, or if you implemented user authentication? \"Implemented full CRUD operations for X food items and managed Y user orders, including user authentication and order history features.\"*\n",
            "    *   For Tic Tac Toe: \"Implemented win detection, player turn handling, and game reset functionality.\" -> *Perhaps \"ensuring a fully functional and engaging game experience.\"*\n",

            "3.  **Refine Executive Summary (Minor Redundancy):**\n",
            "    *   You list many specific skills here. While it's good to highlight, you have a dedicated \"Skills\" section. You could condense this slightly to focus more on *what you can do* with those skills, rather than listing them all again.\n",
            "    *   *Example:* \"Skilled in modern web technologies including React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, alongside foundational database and version control systems.\" (More general, less specific enumeration).\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Expand on Experience (Cloud Computing Intern):**\n",
            "    *   \"Learned fundamental cloud computing concepts including service and deployment models.\"\n",
            "    *   \"Worked on hands-on labs related to cloud infrastructure and application deployment.\"\n",
            "    *   *Could you be more specific about *which* cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) or *which* services you worked with? E.g., \"Gained practical experience with [Specific Cloud Provider] services like EC2, S3, and VPC during hands-on labs.\"* This adds more weight.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Consider an \"Tools\" or \"Developer Environment\" Subsection in Skills:**\n",
            "    *   You mention Git and GitHub, which is good. You could also add common development tools like VS Code, Postman, npm/yarn, etc., if you use them regularly.\n",

(Though for a student, this is often less feasible).\n",
